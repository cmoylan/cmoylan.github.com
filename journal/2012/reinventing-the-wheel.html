  <p>A while back I was working on a Rails site that needed authentication.
<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> is a well-known gem that does
just that. I pulled up the documentation and came across&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are building your first Rails application, we recommend you to not use
  Devise. Devise requires a good understanding of the Rails Framework. In such
  cases, we advise you to start a simple authentication system from scratch, today
  we have two resources:&nbsp;[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Once you have solidified your understanding of
  Rails and authentication mechanisms, we assure you Devise will be very pleasant
  to work with.&nbsp;:)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is awesome. I had never implemented authentication before, so I opened up
the tutorials and got to work. It took slightly longer but I learned much more
than I would have by simply dropping in the&nbsp;gem.</p>
<p>I think this is a great attitude. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of reinventing the
wheel for one&#8217;s own education. I used to get strange looks when I told people
that I wrote my blog from scratch. They would say, “that&#8217;s silly, just use
Wordpress.” But the blog experiment allowed me to learn quite a bit. I made many
mistakes, but I came away a better&nbsp;developer.</p>
<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been working through The Elements of Computing Systems. It&#8217;s about
low-level hardware design. In the book you build an entire computer in
a hardware simulator from simple logic gates. It has been immensely educational
because even though I work with computers every day, I still don&#8217;t know how they
work at a low level. I&#8217;m not going to build my own computer from physical
hardware, but at the end of the book I&#8217;ll be able to. I think that&#8217;s really&nbsp;cool.</p>
<p>The body of knowledge in Computer Science is huge, and growing exponentially.
This is fantastic, but unfortunately it means that everything that came before
The Next Big Thing becomes a black box with an interface that you just trust. If
you&#8217;re just in the game to make a living, I suppose it&#8217;s okay to not know or
care how the lower-level stuff works. But for me curiosity is the primary
motivation and reinventing the wheel from time to time is incredibly&nbsp;satisfying.</p></article>
