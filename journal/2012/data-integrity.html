  <p>You may have noticed that my website has been pretty barren lately. I suffered
massive data loss when the hard drive in my home server died. I had been running
the server as a virtual machine in the hopes that as long as I backed up the
disk image I would be safe from hardware failures. I would have been correct if
I had bothered to back up the disk image. So in late January of this year the
drive failed, the server crashed and I lost&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>When I realized the server wasn&#8217;t coming back on-line, I put a simple page up so
that I wouldn&#8217;t lose my place at the top of Google for &#8220;Chris Moylan&#8221; searches.
I also faced a tricky recovery process. If it had just been my data I would have
shrugged it off and started fresh. But I was also hosting sites for friends,
including the blog of my friend <a href="http://mattbutterfield.com">Matt</a> who had
<em>years</em> of entries and&nbsp;images.</p>
<p>I managed to get everything back in some form or another. Luckily I recovered
all of Matt&#8217;s data and returned it to him. He promptly set up his blog on
a <a href="https://github.com/m-butterfield/m-butterfield.github.com">different host</a>
and I don&#8217;t blame him at all. I decided to pay for email hosting (I had been
hosting it myself) and found an <a href="http://www.tuffmail.com">awesome provider</a>. In
the future, if I want to host my own email server, I can use their service as
a fallback. I took the time to migrate my site over to
<a href="http://hyde.github.com/">Hyde</a>, a static site generator. I had been using
<a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pylons</a>, a Python <span class="caps">MVC</span> framework, but decided
I didn&#8217;t need all of that&nbsp;complexity.</p>
<p>I had some free time last weekend so I set the server up again. I&#8217;m going with
the same setup - a virtual server running on top of a physical server. Unlike
last time, I am going to stick with some sort of backup schedule or add a <span class="caps">RAID</span>
setup. This incident hasn&#8217;t deterred me from running a server out of my closet.
It was a great learning experience, one that I plan to continue. But I now
realize that any system with non-trivial uptime has a non-trivial risk of
catastrophic failure. If you acknowledge this and plan for the day when your data
goes out the window, it&#8217;s not big&nbsp;deal.</p></article>
