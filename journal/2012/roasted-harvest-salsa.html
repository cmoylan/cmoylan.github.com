      Roasted Harvest Salsa
    </nav>
  </header>

  <p>Cassie&#8217;s grandparents live on a farm, which means that every fall we find
ourselves up to our ears in fresh produce. This year, we had lots of tomatoes in
various stages of ripeness. I decided to make some of my roasted salsa last
night to cull the tomato numbers. Because the recipe is so simple and so
delicious (and because I haven&#8217;t posted in a while) I decided to write it&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>So here we&nbsp;go&#8230;</p>
<h2>Roasted Harvest&nbsp;Salsa</h2>
<p>The recipe calls&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 large Roma&nbsp;tomatoes</li>
<li>1&nbsp;jalape&ntilde;o</li>
<li>2 cloves&nbsp;garlic</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup&nbsp;onion</li>
<li>1 teaspoon&nbsp;salt</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, I just use whatever ratio of ingredients I have around. We had quite
a variety of tomatoes, so I picked the ones that were in danger of
over-ripening. The large green ones will become pasta sauce at a later time.

<p>I like to add one extra ingredient: 2 fingers of cheap scotch. Consume liberally
as you work on the salsa.  <a href="http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/salsa/2.jpg"><img alt="Johnny Walker Red is the preferred scotch of Dick

<p>Start by roasting the tomatoes. While this step isn&#8217;t technically necessary, it
gives the salsa a delicious smokey flavor. When I was living with
<a href="http://www.mattbutterfield.com">Matt</a>  we would roast tomatoes by putting them
on baking sheets in the oven. While this certainly got the job done, it also
filled the apartment with a haze and set off the smoke alarms. Now I prefer to
roast on the stove top. Line any pan (preferably cast iron) with aluminum foil,
put over medium heat, open a window, and add the tomatoes.

<p>It&#8217;s good to turn the tomatoes often so that they char evenly. As they soften
some will split. I tried to roast way too many at once. Ideally each tomato will
be well charred on every side. I had too many to manage in this batch, so some
charred, some split and some just softened.

<p>When the tomatoes are done, cut them into quarters and put them in a food
processor. While you can process everything at once, we like to do the tomatoes
separately so that we can squeeze them in a cheese cloth to remove excess water.

<p>Next roast the peppers and garlic. It&#8217;s important to leave the garlic unpeeled
for this step.  <a href="http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/salsa/6.jpg"><img alt="more
roasty" src="http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/salsa/thumbs/6.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In this picture the garlic is done. The peppers could use some more time in the
skillet but I got impatient.  <a href="http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/salsa/7.jpg"><img alt="more
charry" src="http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/salsa/thumbs/7.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>When the garlic has cooled, peel it. Cut the stems off the peppers. At this
point you can seed them if you want, or just leave the seeds in for more heat.
We like to leave the seeds. Add the peppers, garlic and some onion (I used half
an onion for this batch) to the food processor. I like chunky salsa, so I pulsed
it a few times to get everything cut up, but not pureed. Add the mix to your
tomatoes. Add salt and anything else you think might be good. We added a bit of
cilantro to our mix.
<a href="http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/salsa/8.jpg"><img alt="blendy" src="http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/salsa/thumbs/8.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Mix it up. If you make a small batch of salsa you can put everything in the food
processor at once and then this step is unnecessary. In this case, there were so
many tomatoes that we  had to do them separately.

<p>Enjoy. This salsa is simple and really good. The roasting will make your kitchen
smell great for a few&nbsp;days.</p></article>
