  <p>When I was in high school my favorite album was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkerton_%28album%29">Pinkerton</a> by the band
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer">Weezer</a>.  I listened to that album every
night before going to bed. I was in a band myself, getting into recording and
mixing. I listened intently to Pinkerton and other Weezer albums trying to pick
out every guitar track. I made detailed notes about where each instrument/vocal
part appeared in the mix. I studied the arrangements of the songs just as much as
any of my&nbsp;homework.</p>
<p>The entire time I did this I was listening to these records on earbuds or cheap
headphones - the kind they used to give out on planes. When I started to record
my own music, I got fed up with them and asked my parents for a pair of real,
over-the-ear, headphones.  That Christmas, I got a pair of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mdr700&amp;tbm=isch">Sony
<span class="caps">MDR</span>-V700s</a>. (<em>Note:</em> Yes these
are <span class="caps">DJ</span> headphones and are geared towards electronic and hip-hop music. But they
are very capable of reproducing other&nbsp;genres.)</p>
<p>The first thing I listened to on the 700s was Pinkerton. I put in the <span class="caps">CD</span>,
plugged in the headphones, and pushed play. I was amazed at the clarity
- everything was crisp and bright. This much I had expected. What came next was
unexpected.  Thirty seconds into the first song I heard a guitar part I had
never heard before. I was astounded. I had studied that album inside and out.
I knew all of the guitar parts, yet here was a guitar I had never heard before.
I started the track over and listened closely. I had not imagined it. It was
faint, but it was definitely there. From then on I was convinced that not all
headphones were created&nbsp;equally.</p>
<p>Several years later, I was in college recording an album professionally. In the
control room, even before the instruments were properly equalized, the mix would
sound phenomenal. Every night we would take a <span class="caps">CD</span> of that day&#8217;s session and
listen to it on the drive home. It always sounded terrible in the car. We would
listen to it on small portable stereos. What had sounded so good on $10k+ studio
monitors always sounded muddy and uneven on lesser speakers.  We would go back
the next day and tweak all of the parts that sounded bad on the cheaper stereos.
I was always a little bitter about this because we had to assume that people
would be listening to our music on iPods, and mix to the lowest common
denomimator -&nbsp;earbuds.</p>
<p>You would think that a song would sound the same everywhere. I mean, why
wouldn&#8217;t it?  But when you think about the huge variations in speakers, even
between headphones and earbuds (never mind actual stereos), there&#8217;s no way it
could. The equipment you use to listen to music matters. Sound is an interesting
thing. It&#8217;s all physics - pressure waves in the air. No two speakers move air
exactly the same way, so a song cannot sound exactly the same&nbsp;everywhere.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about headphones, though, is that mid-range headphones
($50-$150) will sound orders of magnitude better than cheap headphones and
earbuds. You do not have to spend much at all to get a huge improvement in sound
quality. I&#8217;m sure everyone knows someone with a big pair of over-the-ear
headphones. Take your iPod over to that person and ask to listen to your
favorite song on their headphones. Turn up the volume a reasonable
amount, close your eyes and just listen.  I can assure you it will sound
incredible compared to earbuds.  When you&#8217;re convinced, go buy a pair of ugly
and generic-looking headphones for under $100.  They will be the best investment
you&#8217;ve made in a&nbsp;while.</p></article>
