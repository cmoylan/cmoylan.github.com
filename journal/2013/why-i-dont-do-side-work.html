  <p>Ambitious people have ideas. And when ambitious people find out that I&#8217;m
a programmer they often ask if I want to help them build their ideas. The answer
is almost always &#8220;No&#8221; but not for the reasons you&nbsp;think.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;m&nbsp;bored</h2>
<p>A lot of people in the startup scene around here are
multi-taskers.  They work for a startup (or three), and bootstrap their own
startup in their free time. I&#8217;m not sure if this is just the personality of
entrepreneurs or if these people are trying to throw out as many ideas as
possible on the chance that one will be a hit and net them millions. But in
general, people in startups work <em>really</em>&nbsp;hard.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind helping people build their ideas (especially at market rate.) But
most of the time the idea involves some variation on a web app. Maybe there&#8217;s
a mobile component thrown in there.  That&#8217;s fine. The problem is that I&#8217;ve been
making web apps my entire professional life. I learned to program so that
I could make my website more dynamic. Web apps are not particularly interesting
to me anymore. Any desire I have to work on them is fulfilled by my <a href="http://www.snapsheetapp.com">day
job</a>.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s not a good&nbsp;idea</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t take it personally, but I don&#8217;t think anything is a good idea. The caveat
here is that I mean <em>anything</em>. Twitter? Dumb. Foursquare? Idiotic. If you had
approached me with the idea for Facebook, I would have said &#8220;that&#8217;s stupid,
people can already do that with Myspace&#8221; and walked away. I am a terrible judge
of&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p>The few ideas that I do consider good are insanely ambitious. Take
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a> for example. Here is a company
doing things that only First World governments with paranoid defense budgets
have done before. That&#8217;s brilliant. So if you come up with the next SpaceX, give
me a&nbsp;call.</p>
<h2>Work&nbsp;is&#8230;work</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is strictly America, or more capitalism in general, but
a lot of people seem to think working and being busy are ends unto themselves.
We think that if you&#8217;re not working, you&#8217;re being lazy. I think there is
a difference between being busy and being productive. I solve a surprising number
of problems in the shower. It&#8217;s the nature of thought work. Sometimes the
quickest way to figure out a problem is to stop thinking about it - you can&#8217;t go
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ham"><span class="caps">HAM</span></a> all of the time
otherwise you burn out. So I put in my hours, but I&#8217;m not afraid to call it
a&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t <em>program</em> in my free time. I love learning and am
always trying out new programs/languages. At this moment in time I&#8217;m working
through <a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org">Learn C the Hard Way</a>, <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">The Elements
of Computing Systems</a> and <a href="ihttp://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for
Great Good</a>. Learning for me means trying out
things I&#8217;ve never done before. That&#8217;s exciting. Making yet another web app&#8230;not
so&nbsp;much.</p></article>
