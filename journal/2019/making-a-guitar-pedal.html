      Building a guitar pedal
    </nav>
  </header>

  <p>I woke up New Year&#8217;s Day groggy with a slight hangover. What better cure than
strong coffee and solder fumes? So down to the basement! There was a project
already on the bench that just needed a few more&nbsp;wires.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="http://www.mesaboogie.com/support/out-of-production/tremoverb.html">large tube amp</a>
that has been gathering dust since I moved to the city.
Now that I don&#8217;t share walls with anyone it&#8217;s time to revive it. I&#8217;ve never been
completely happy with the sound. Fortunately, the world of guitar electronics is
much less complicated than other electronics and you can still tinker without
needing an advanced&nbsp;degree.</p>
<p>My plan for the amp is to switch the power tubes (to brighten the sound), leave
out half of them (to lower the volume), get a smaller speaker cabinet (to lower
the volume further), run an <span class="caps">EQ</span> in the effects loop (to shape the sound a little
more) and drive the amp with a boost pedal (to increase the guitar signal and
overdrive the&nbsp;tubes.)</p>
<p>Working in reverse order the first item on the list was the boost pedal. Not
content to buy one and move on I decided to build one. There are many different
kinds of boost pedals. Some increase the signal without coloring it - clean
boost. Others increase the signal to the point of clipping - overdrive. Most
have some tone controls to cut or boost frequencies. There is a legendary
overdrive pedal called the <a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/tube-screamer-analysis">Tube Screamer</a>
that I have always wanted to try.
People much smarter than myself like to reverse engineer guitar pedals and post
the schematics <a href="http://tonepad.com/projects.asp?projectType=fx">online</a>.
I found such a version and decided to build&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The website hosting the plans sells printed circuit boards. I bought one of
their boards and ordered the rest of the parts. The circuit board is just for
the effect - it doesn’t include anything for turning the effect on or off or
even connecting it to a guitar signal. That part is left up to you. I looked up
how to do this and ordered the extra supplies to build a complete&nbsp;pedal.</p>
<p>When everything arrived I soldered the components onto the circuit board. I
wanted to test it before wiring up the enclosure so I built a test bracket and
wired the board onto that. I was getting power from a small power supply that I
use for prototyping. I connected my guitar and the amp to the test bracket and
held my breath as I turned everything on. No smoke! But also no&nbsp;sound.</p>
<p><a href="http://chrismoylan.com/images/journal/tube-screamer/test-harness-full.jpg"><img alt="The test harness" src="http://chrismoylan.com/images/journal/tube-screamer/test-harness-thumb.jpg" />
</a> The board set up
for&nbsp;testing</p>
<p>I double-checked every connection, making sure I had placed all of the
components correctly. Then I saw the problem. I was supplying 5V of power when
the circuit needed 9V. Classic. When I switched to 9V I heard the speaker in the
amp buzz to life. I plucked a few strings on the guitar and the amp responded.
The sound was nice - a crisp crunch. It was&nbsp;working!</p>
<p>To house the effect I used a metal box about the size of 2 decks of playing
cards. With calipers I carefully measured out where I wanted the holes for knobs
and jacks. I drilled them all out. Unfortunately I did not measure perfectly so
the finished product looks hand-made. (I prefer the term “artisanal.”) After
placing the knobs and jacks in the enclosure it was time to wire it all
together. This was the most difficult part of the project because it
involved a lot of wire routing and free-hand soldering. It’s nice to have plenty
of wire to work with, but in a small enclosure it can easily become a&nbsp;headache.</p>
<p>The wiring scheme I used is called “<a href="http://screaminfx.com/tech/what-is-true-bypass-guitar-pedal.htm">true bypass</a>”
because when the pedal is
turned off the guitar signal is completely bypassing the effect. Most
mass-produced pedals are not true bypass. The guitar signal is always undergoing
some processing. Each style has dis/advantages. Non-true-bypass involves extra
circuitry, and for homebrew pedals doesn’t make sense. My pedal uses a
double-throw switch to send the guitar signal either through the effect circuit
and then to the output (when on) or straight to the output (when&nbsp;off.)</p>
<p>When the solder had cooled I took the pedal upstairs and again connected it
between the guitar and the amp. I turned everything on. No smoke! But again no
sound. The pedal has a green <span class="caps">LED</span> to show when it’s turned on. This did not light
up, so presumably the issue was power. I was using a 9V adapter with a barrel
plug to power the pedal. I switched it with an adapter from one of my guitar
pedals and that worked. But why? I knew the first adapter was working because I
tested it in another piece of equipment. The answer still puzzles me, but I
guess it’s “just how it is.” A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_power_connector">barrel plug</a>
has 2 connections - the outside of
the barrel is called the sleeve and the inside (which is electrically isolated)
is called the tip. Every power supply I have ever used puts the ground on the
sleeve and the voltage on the tip. Except guitar pedals. For whatever reason
they use the tip as the ground and supply voltage on the sleeve. I should have
fried my pedal when I plugged in the first adapter and ran the current
backwards. Fortunately the <span class="caps">LED</span> saved the day. (An <span class="caps">LED</span> is a diode and current can
only flow in one direction through&nbsp;it.)</p>
<p>Here’s the finished&nbsp;product.</p>
