      Restraint and the Right Thing

  <p>In computer programming, there is this idea called the Right Thing - that for a
given programming problem there is one, and only one, correct solution. This
idea is mostly obsolete, but many programers still believe&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>According to Steven Levy in the book <a href="">Hackers</a>, the idea of the Right Thing sprang
up at <span class="caps">MIT</span> in the 1960s. At that point, the idea was valid, but there are some
points to note about the programming environment at the that time and&nbsp;place:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone had similar technical&nbsp;abilities</li>
<li>Everyone was working on the same&nbsp;architecture</li>
<li>Memory and processing power were extremely&nbsp;limited</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that environment, it is easy to see how one could conclude that there was
only one correct way to solve a given problem. If you only have a kilobyte of
memory, you cut corners to get everything to fit. If your <span class="caps">CPU</span> is running in the
kilohertz, you make every clock cycle count. And so you ended up with programs
that were as short and clever as possible to make the best use of the limited
resources. This was okay, because the programming group was a monoculture,
and your peers could be expected to understand and appreciate your&nbsp;cleverness.</p>
<p>But those constraints no longer apply. Let&#8217;s constrast that environment with our
current&nbsp;one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone has different technical&nbsp;abilities</li>
<li>Everyone is probably working on the same architecture, but may be working on
   different&nbsp;architectures</li>
<li>Memory and processing power are vast, readily-available, and&nbsp;cheap.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every constraint placed on the early programmers is now gone. Software teams can
choose how to optimize their programming environments. The Right Thing is now
relative. Maybe you&#8217;re working on a problem that takes a lot of processing
power, so you optimize for that. Maybe you deal with terabytes of data, so
memory and space are still constraints. If you work with embedded systems, you
will have to deal with&nbsp;both.</p>
<p>Realistically though, most of us are web developers working on problems that are
neither new nor novel. We take data, store it, and return it at a later
time. That&#8217;s it. Given that environment, the Right Thing is different. The
biggest cost on a software team is the programmers themselves. Therefore, care
should be taken to write code that is easy to understand and easy to
maintain. If that is done, the pool of programmers available is as large as
possible. Clever code requies clever programmers to untangle, and they often
come at a&nbsp;price.</p>
<p>In the first draft of this essay, I wrote that &#8220;dumb code was the new Right
Thing.&#8221;  But this is not correct. Dumb code is easy to write, but not very easy
to maintain. It&#8217;s what you write when you are a novice, or when you need a quick
script that will run once. Clever code is worse. It is difficult to write and
even harder to maintain. (And often, the programmer is not as clever as they
think.) The balance (as always) is somewhere in the middle, and this is where
restraint comes in. You write dumb code as a novice, clever code when you know
just enough to be dangerous, and maintainable code when you have the knowledge
to be clever, but the wisdom to restrain&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>Programmers are right up there next to evangelicals when it comes to being
dogmatic and bull-headed. There is a reason that famous programming arguments
have been called &#8220;religious wars.&#8221; We learn design patterns. We learn about
objects, factories, Single Responsibility and Tell Don&#8217;t Ask. We learn a slew of
other acronyms. And we try to use all of this any chance we get, because it&#8217;s
the &#8220;Right Thing.&#8221; But that&#8217;s academic. Anyone in industry is not being paid to
be academic. The <span class="caps">CEO</span> is paying you to (1) ship and (2) not cost them an arm and
a leg when you decide to leave but your code&nbsp;stays.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting that we throw all the design concepts out the window. I think
many of those ideas can still be useful. But we have to be aware that every
pattern or abstraction we introduce is one more roadblock in the way of that new
programmer trying to understand our code. So if you decide to introduce that
roadblock, you&#8217;d better have a good justification for doing so. And you know
that fancy <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ServiceLocatorFactoryBean.html">ServiceLocatorFactoryBean</a> you&#8217;ve been working on? You&#8217;re not going to
need&nbsp;it.</p></article>
